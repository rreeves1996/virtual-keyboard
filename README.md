## About

<img src='./src/assets/app.PNG' alt='screenshot' width="600">

My version of a virtual keyboard using React. Besides the fact that I've wanted to create my own version of a virtual keyboard for awhile now, I thought it would be fun and good practice to create it using React.
My goals included:
* Utilize useState and useEffect for the core functionalities of the app
* Effective use components, create components with as much reusability as possible
* Interactive UI: I wanted the keys and anything else the user interacts with to feel "correct" and reactive. One of the biggest components (hah) of keyboards that we don't even realize is tactile feedback - I wanted to replicate this as much as possible without a physical keyboard
* Responsive design: Most importantly, the design needs to be responsive and catered to a mobile first layout. The majority of real-world applications of a virtual keyboard involve mobile functionality - without any mobile functionality/responsiveness, the app doesn't have many (if any) use cases.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Optimize mobile layout as much as possible
    - [ ] Mobile specific animations for keys
    - [ ] Landscape and portrait keyboard
- [ ] Put keyboard in to its own component
- [ ] Put textarea in its own component with keyboard
- [ ] Tab key, enter key
